# JumpSuit's protocol specification

Messages are serialized with a custom protocol before being sent. This document references JumpSuit's protocol.

The protocol's endianness is big-endian.
Strings are always encoded as **UTF-8**. When the protocol mandates the length of a string, it is implied the length is an amount of bytes.
Angles are always encoded as **brads**.
When a value takes only one byte, 1 means enabled and 0 means disabled.


## Notation

Possible values for a field are noted:

 * with a number for the packet type (ex: `4`)
 * with lowercase words for variables (ex: `player name`)
 * with lowercase words between double quotes for strings variables (`"player name"`)
 * with lowercase words starting with a uppercase character for enumerations (ex: `Error Type`)
 * with uppercase snake case for packets and subpayloads (ex: `LOBBY_STATE`)

Values dubbed `unused bits` are not used, but are present to complete a byte.

Values are enclosed in boxes.
The minus signs (-) indicates the value is required and not repeated.
The tilde (~) indicates the value is optional and not repeated.
The equal sign (=) indicates the value is optional and repeated.

```
         1B
+---------------------+
| value taking 1 byte |
+---------------------+

               4b
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
| optional value taking 4 bits |
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+

                   4B  <- this is the space taken by ONE value, not the total amount
+======================================+
| value repeated between 4 and 6 times |
+======================================+
                   4-6
```

When the value is a payload or a subpayload, the space it takes isn't mentioned, you should refer to the section of this document about it.


## Packets

The first byte of every packet determines its type. A payload may be placed after this first byte. The payload may contain subpayloads or payloads.

```
   1B       ?B
+------+-----------
| Type | payload...
+------+-----------
```


## Subpayloads

Subpayloads are sequences of bytes which are always defined after the same scheme. They often represent an entity with multiples properties.
They might be used several times in a packet or in packets with different types.


#### PLANET
```
+--------------+------------+
| PLANET_CONST | PLANET_MUT |
+--------------+------------+
```


#### PLANET_CONST
```
       2B            2B           2B      1B
+--------------+--------------+--------+------+
| x-coordinate | y-coordinate | radius | Type |
+--------------+--------------+--------+------+
```

`Type` must be either:
 0. concrete
 1. grass


#### PLANET_MUT
```
     1B         1B
+----------+----------+
| Owned By | progress |
+----------+----------+
```

Owned By must be either:
 0. `neutral`
 1. `blue team`
 2. `beige team`
 3. `green team`
 4. `pink team`
 5. `yellow team`


#### ENEMY
```
+-------------+-----------+
| ENEMY_CONST | ENEMY_MUT |
+-------------+-----------+
```


#### ENEMY_CONST

      2B              2B           1B
+--------------+--------------+------------+

+--------------+--------------+------------+
```

`Appearance` must be either:
 0. `enemyBlack1`
 1. `enemyBlack2`
 2. `enemyBlack3`
 3. `enemyBlack4`
 4. `enemyBlack5`
 5. `enemyBlue1`
 6. `enemyBlue2`

 8. `enemyBlue4`
 9. `enemyBlue5`
 10. `enemyGreen1`
 11. `enemyGreen2`
 12. `enemyGreen3`
 13. `enemyGreen4`
 14. `enemyGreen5`
 15. `enemyRed1`
 16. `enemyRed2`
 17. `enemyRed3`
 18. `enemyRed4`
 19. `enemyRed5`


#### ENEMY_MUT
```
   1B
+-------+
| angle |

```


#### PLAYER
```
+--------------+------------+
| PLAYER_CONST | PLAYER_MUT |
+--------------+------------+
```


#### PLAYER_CONST
```
      1B          5b         3b         1B            1B        0-255B
+-----------+-------------+---------------------+-------------+--------+
| player id | unused bits | Team | homograph id | name length | "name" |
+-----------+-------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+
```
The `homograph id` is used to distinguish players with the same name. It is unique for every player with the same name.

`Team` must be either:
 0. `blue team`
 1. `beige team`
 2. `green team`
 3. `pink team`
 4. `yellow team`


#### PLAYER_MUT
```
     1B            2B             2B               1B           1B        1B           1b         1b       1b       3b           6b            2b              2b
+-----------+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-------+-----------+------------+---------+------+------------+-------------+--------------+----------------+
| player id | x-coordinate | y-coordinate | attached planet | angle | aim angle | looks left | jetpack | hurt | Walk Frame | unused bits | Armed Weapon | Carried Weapon |
+-----------+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-------+-----------+------------+---------+------+------------+-------------+--------------+----------------+
```
If `attached planet`'s value is 255, the player is not attached to a planet. This also means there cannot be more than 255 planets.

**`looks left` IS NOW USELESS SINCE IT CAN BE DEDUCTED FROM `AIM_ANGLE`.**

`Walk Frame` must be either:
 0. `duck`
 1. `jump`
 2. `stand`
 3. `walk1`
 4. `walk2`

`Armed Weapon` and `Carried Weapon` must be either:
 0. `Lmg`
 1. `Smg`
 2. `Shotgun`
 3. `Sniper`


#### SHOT
```
       2B             2B         1B       1B         6b         2b
+--------------+--------------+-------+--------+-------------+------+
| x-coordinate | y-coordinate | angle | origin | unused bits | type |
+--------------+--------------+-------+----------------------+------+
```

`origin` is 255 when emitted by an enemy. However, since it is possible to have a player whose `id` is 255, this could lead to conflicts. **THIS PROBLEM MUST BE FIXED**, for example by using the `unused bits`.


#### ENABLED_TEAMS
```
      3b                   5b
+-------------+------------------------+
| unused bits |      enabled teams     |
+-------------+ -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - +
              | e.g.:  0 1 0 1 0       |
              |          ^   ^         |
              |          |   |         |
              |          |   alienPink |
              |          alienBlue     |
              +------------------------+
```

## Game cycle

A lobby can be in one of 3 different states:
 * warmup
 * playing
 * displaying scores
